# Yet Another Static Site Generator (This time in C++)

[![CMake](https://github.com/shubhamkrm/yass/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shubhamkrm/yass/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

This generator is used for creating [My Blog](https://kumaram.dev). It uses
Markdown files with a simplified frontmatter format for posts, and mustache
templates for defining themes. I plan to add plugin support to it soon.

### TODO:
 - [ ] Add Installation and Usage instuctions on the ReadMe.
 - [ ] Create a simple setup workflow.
